In this project, we constructed an autonomus automotive robot, using an Arduino Uno, that has the ability to move randomly in space without colliding to any obstacle. When an obstacle is detected the robot stops and creates a new course in space making the best decision. In more detail when the robot encounters an obstacle, it stops and scans the area in front of it using an Infrared Proximity Sensor and storing the distances for every 5 degrees that servo moves. When the scanning procedure is completed, the microcontroller sends the cartography wireless through an Xbee module attached on the microcontroller. Then a second Xbee that is located in the base station is attached on a usb explorer, receives the data and through the serial port sends the data to Matlab that is responsible for the illustration of the space in front of the robot. To complete this project we used two DC motors (0.5 A) responsible for moving the wheels of the vehicle (left - right, forward - reverse) and a Sharp GP2D12 analog distance sensor to measure the distance of every obstacle that may occur. To power the circuit we use two batteries as voltage sources (9V , 6V) which through a voltage regulator (L7805CV) powers the Arduino and the integrated circuit (DIP-16 L293D) respectively. The integrated circuit is responsible to reverse the polarity to the DC motors. Finally, we attached a LCD display responsible to give us information about the decision that the robot has made.
