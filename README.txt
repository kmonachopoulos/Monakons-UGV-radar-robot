In this project we constructed an automotive robot that has the ability to move randomly in space withought colliding with any obstacles. If an obstacle is detected the robot stops and create a new course in space. In more detail when the robot encounters an obstacle, it stops and scans the area in front of it, then sends the cartography wirelessly through an Xbee module attached on arduino uno microcontroller. Later on a second Xbee located in a base station, attached on a usb explorer, we receive the data and through serial port we send the data to Matlab illustrating the space is in front of the robot.
