In this project we constructed an automotive robot that has the ability to move randomly in space without colliding to any obstacle. When an obstacle is detected the robot stops and creates a new course in space. In more detail when the robot encounters an obstacle, it stops and scans the area in front of it using an Infrared Proximity Sensor and storing the distances for every 5 degrees that servo moves. When the scanning procedure is completed, the microcontroller sends the cartography wireless through an Xbee module attached on Arduino Uno microcontroller. Then a second Xbee that is located in the base station is attached on a usb explorer, receives the data and through serial port sends the data to Matlab that is responsible for the illustration of the space is in front of the robot.
